# MovieFinderUI

This project is to partially emulate Netflix or Amazon's PrimeVideo Streaming video streaming services.

The application allows users to create and account and browse movies to gain various insights, for the current early stage of the project, the details are limited to genres, name, release date, and a quick synopsis of the movie.

Taking in users' needs and wants, the design of the application takes advantage of Human-Computer Heuristics and Human Psychology to improve and teach the users' how to work the application. Utilizing the size and color of all interactive elements, the users' are given cues as to how to operate the application

MovieFinder is created with ReactJS and TypeScript
The decision to make the MovieFinder based on ReactJS and TypeScript can be encapsulated around two simple ideologies, "Consistency" and "Simplicity".

A great downfall for JavaScript is its malleability. It is a language that can change drastically without the developers' knowledge and such that it causes a great deal of time when debugging is required. With using TypeScript, the benefits of JavaScript are still at the disposal of the developers with the added benefit of static typing. Similar to Java and C#, TypeScript allows developers to strictly type a variable, ensuring that the correct primitive type gets passed in as a parameter, for example. This greatly reduces the amount of guesswork needed when debugging is required.

Using ReactJS is the result of extending the simplicity aspect of creating an user friendly interface. With ReactJS' powerful capacity to modularize, the code base can be split and compartmentalized into smaller component entities. These smaller entities reduce clutter and enhance readability. Rather than parsing through a file with an overwhelming amount of code, ReactJS modulability naturally breaks down large code into smaller more manageable pieces.
