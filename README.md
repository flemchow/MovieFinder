# MovieFinder

After learning about HCI (Human-Computer Intereaction) in class, it became apparent to me that applications with high positive user experience are generally interfaces that focuses on learnability and discoverability (applications that are out of the box easy to use and work with). I believe that to acheive such a result, a clean and consice interface would be beneficial, and my choice in technologies reflected this belief.

MovieFinder is a personal passion project. Its primary purposed is to provide a platform for me to learn how to develop a ReactJS application using TypeScript.

ReactJS is used because of its high modularity, compactability, and resuability capacities. I feel that these embody my ideology and philosophy very well. To ensure that approach my development in a strict methodical method, I used TypeScript as my programming language of choice. TypeScript with its strict typing and consistency allowed results to be easier to predict. Furthermore, since I recently began development with a Test Driven approach, the typing made it easier to create code and test cases that are easy to read and understand.
